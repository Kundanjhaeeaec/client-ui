# Chatbot Google Form Integration Setup

## Overview
Your chatbot now collects user information through a conversational flow and submits it to Google Sheets via Google Apps Script.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Update Google Apps Script URL
In `src/components/Chatbot/ActionProvider.js`, find this line:
```javascript
const scriptURL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';
```

Replace it with your actual Google Apps Script web app URL.

### 2. Google Apps Script Code
Use the existing `google-apps-script.js` file in your project. The script already includes:
- Form data processing
- Anti-spam protection
- Rate limiting
- Email validation
- Data sanitization

### 3. Test the Chatbot Flow
Users can now:
1. Say "enroll", "sign up", or "get started" to begin enrollment
2. Provide their name, email, phone number
3. Select a course (Java, React, Angular, Full Stack, Job Support)
4. Choose experience level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
5. Share their goal (e.g., "Get a job", "Switch careers")
6. Automatically submit to your Google Sheet
